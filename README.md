## **Credits**

This project was inspired by UC Berkeley's **Pacman AI Projects**. The foundational concepts of search algorithms and AI-driven strategies were adapted and extended for educational purposes to create the Space Invaders project.  

I gratefully acknowledge the original work and efforts of the developers of the Pacman AI Projects at UC Berkeley.  

**Attribution Information:**  
The Pacman AI Projects were developed at UC Berkeley. The core projects and autograders were primarily created by **John DeNero** (denero@cs.berkeley.edu) and **Dan Klein** (klein@cs.berkeley.edu). Additional contributions to student-side autograding were made by **Brad Miller**, **Nick Hay**, and **Pieter Abbeel** (pabbeel@cs.berkeley.edu).
